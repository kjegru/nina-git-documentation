# Introduction to Git - The Basics

## What is Git?
Git is like a time machine for your code. It keeps track of all changes you make to your files, allowing you to:
- Save different versions of your work
- Collaborate with others
- Go back in time if something breaks

## Local vs Online Repositories
Think of Git like this:

### Local Repository (Your Computer)
- Like working on documents saved on your computer
- Only you can see and work with these files
- Changes are saved locally
- You have full version history on your machine

### Online Repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- Like OneDrive/Dropbox for your code
- Others can see and work with your files
- Acts as a backup of your work
- Enables collaboration with team members

## How They Work Together
1. You work on files locally
2. Save (commit) changes on your computer
3. Send (push) these changes to the online repository
4. Others can download (pull) your changes
5. Repeat!

## Common Workflow
1. Download online or create local project (`git clone` or `git init`)
2. Make changes to files
3. Save changes (`git add` and `git commit`)
4. [connect to online project](guides/git-basics-guide.md)
5. Share changes online (`git push`)
6. Get others' changes (`git pull`)
